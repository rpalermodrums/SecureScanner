# SecureScanner Web Interface Design Document

## Overview

The SecureScanner web interface will be built using SolidStart, leveraging its server-side rendering capabilities and streaming features. This interface will provide an intuitive way to initiate scans, view results, and manage SCAP content updates.

## Key Features

1. Dashboard
   - Overview of recent scans
   - System status
   - Quick actions (start new scan, update content)

2. Scan Management
   - Initiate new scans
   - Select profiles and benchmark files
   - View scan progress in real-time

3. Results Viewer
   - List of completed scans
   - Detailed view of scan results
   - Filtering and sorting options
   - Export results in various formats

4. Content Management
   - View available SCAP content
   - Initiate and track content updates

5. Settings
   - Configure scan parameters
   - Manage notification preferences

## Technical Architecture

1. Frontend
   - SolidStart for server-side rendering and streaming
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - SolidJS for reactive UI components

2. Backend
   - Node.js server to handle API requests
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Integration with Docker for running scans and updates

3. Data Flow
   - Server-side rendering for initial load
   - Client-side navigation for smooth transitions
   - Streaming updates for long-running processes (scans, updates)

## UI/UX Considerations

- Clean, modern interface with a focus on readability
- Real-time updates to provide immediate feedback
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile usage
- Accessibility features for inclusive usage

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up SolidStart project structure
2. Implement core layout and navigation
3. Develop individual features (Dashboard, Scan Management, etc.)
4. Integrate with backend services (scan execution, result parsing)
5. Implement real-time updates using streaming
6. Add export functionality for scan results
7. Perform testing and optimization
8. Deploy and document

## Security Considerations

- Implement authentication and authorization
- Secure API endpoints
- Sanitize user inputs
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Support for custom scanning rules
- Automated remediation suggestions
- Historical trend analysis
